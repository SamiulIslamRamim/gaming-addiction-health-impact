# Impacts of Game Addiction

### Project Overview

This project provides a statistical analysis of the impacts of game addiction on the physical and mental health of university and school-level students. It uses a survey dataset to investigate the correlation between excessive gaming and various health-related issues. The study aims to highlight the adverse effects of game addiction, such as sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, social isolation, and degradation of academic performance.

### Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to explore the relationship between the time students spend gaming and its effects on their physical and mental well-being. By visualizing and analyzing survey data, the study intends to quantify the impact of game addiction and raise awareness about its potential negative consequences.

***

### Methodology

The analysis was conducted using Python and key data science libraries within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The methodology involved:
1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering data through a survey targeting school and university students.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the raw data to handle inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the dataset to understand demographic distributions and identify relationships between variables.
4.  **Data Visualization:** Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create pie charts, bar charts, and count plots to present the findings clearly.

### Project Files

* `GameAddition_Impacts.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
* `Report on Impacts of Game Addiction.pdf`: The detailed project report which includes the abstract, methodology, findings, and conclusion.

### Key Findings

The analysis reveals a significant correlation between increased gaming hours and negative health outcomes. Key observations from the study include:
* A majority of students who game for more than five hours daily report experiencing depression, sleep deprivation, and social isolation.
* Physical health problems are more prevalent among students with longer gaming durations.
* The study concludes that game addiction is a serious issue that can lead to severe physical and mental health problems if not managed.
